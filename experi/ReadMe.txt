Software protection emulator has the following benefits:
1. It does not require AAM (Adobe Application Manager).
2. It does not perform a background license check while the user is saving files/using menus/any other operation in Adobe apps.
3. All possible features will become available in all installed Adobe apps.
4. It does not require Administrator's right/elevation to run the app and does not require any kind of registration in the operating system.
5. It does not create/modify/update the Abobe application database, so it will not be used by the emulator at all.
6. It does not send statistics to Adobe.
7. It does create license labels and license cache.
8. It bypasses all regional limitations.
9. It disables all kind of tracking (logging) for all apps.
